# singularity_imgs
A collection of Singularity images


This repo is meant to help me get acquainted with Singularity containers and the shub interface. This repo links with a collection on Singularity hub. Every time a .simg is pushed to this repo, a build is triggered on shub.

To use a container, execute something like the following in the command line:

singularity <COMMAND> shub://jhamer90811/singularity_imgs:MYCONTAINER.simg <ARGS>
